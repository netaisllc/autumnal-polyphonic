# APP

## Lineage

This is a project based on the template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template-webpack.

## Stack

The projects uses Svelte 3 and XStateJS 4.6.x for declarative state implementation. The data store is TBD. The intention is to implement this
in a serverless fashion so for now an application framework is TBD; we might explore using Sapper.

## Services

This commit enables _basic_ services any app needs namely:

* client-side routing
* modal handling
* scrim service
* drawer navigation

Next steps will be to add in domain specific logic.
